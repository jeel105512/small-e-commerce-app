Naming Conventions:

MVC relies upon naming conventions to support core functionality. Naming conventions can be a bit of a catch-up, but once you get use to it you'll appreciate their nature.

Controllers: All controllers are named after the pluralized version of the resource:
    ResourcesController (or) TodosController

Models: All models are named after the singular version of the resource:
    ResourceModel (or) TodoModel

Views: All views are placed in a folder named after the controller. Each view is named after the action that will render it:
    resources/index (or) todos/index

Routes: Routes can be anything, but common convention is to name the route with the resource and the action. There are some default routes though:
    GET => /resource (or) /todo -> calls the ResourceController action index()
    GET => /resource/:id (or) /todo/:id -> calls the ResourceController action show($id)

None default routes will display the action in the route as well:
    GET => /resource/edit/:id (or) /todo/edit/:id -> calls the ResourceController action edit($id)
    POST => /resource/create (or) /todo/create -> calls the ResourceController action create()
